		<h2>Overview</h2>
		We created and used Bezier curves to better understand how models can become smoother with controllable curves. We used these Bezier curves first in the 1st dimension 
		and then used them to smoothen out models in the 2nd dimensions. We then up-scaled the smoothing of models to the 3rd dimension. To do so we implemented 
		loop subdivision, in which we further divide a triangle mesh, which would add more detail to the model. We created two new functions, Edge Flip and 
		Edge Split, to assist us with loop subscaling in the final step. What we found most interesting was the power of Bezier curves being able to map nearly any object.

		<h2>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h2>

		<h3>Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
		De Casteljau's subdivision algorithm makes up a series of subdivisions that recursively creates linear interpolations 
		between the control points that are specified. The result of running through the algorithm is a point that lies 
		on the Bezier curve. To implement it we followed the equation: p'<sub>i</sub> which is the next subdivision level 
		and the current subdivision of p<sub>i</sub>.  
		<br>
		
		p'<sub>i</sub> = lerp(p<sub>i</sub>, p<sub>i + 1</sub>, t) = (1 - t) * p<sub>i</sub> + t * p<sub>i + 1</sub> where p<sub>i + 1</sub> is the connecting control point. The value t represents the weight or “influence” of each control point on the final Bezier curve.

		<h3>Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau</h3>
		To extend de Casteljau's algorithm to Bezier surfaces we apply the same logic as task one and first parameterize 
		each row of the control points with the parameter u resulting in one final point. We lerp over those new final single 
		points and now parametrize over v until we have the final point that now lies on the Bezier surface. The result is a 
		Bezier surface that is applied to the teapot object. 
		<br>
		<br>
		To implement this we used the evaluateStep function to output the next subdivision level. Evaluate1D was used to 
		get the final single point on the Bezier line of parameter t and we used the evaluate function to find the point 
		on the surface. So to find this point on the Bezier surface, we first call evaluate which calls evaluate1D on each 
		row of the control points parametrized by u in a for loop and then add these final single points to the vector. 
		With this series of final points which is done through calls to evaluateStep to do the lerps, we then parametrize 
		over v using evaluate 1D to get the final single point that lies on the Bezier surface at the given parameter u and v.

		<h2>Section II: Triangle Meshes and Half-Edge Data Structure</h2>

		<h3>Part 3: Area-weighted vertex normals</h3>
		To find the area-weighted normal vector for a specific vertex position on the mesh, we first traversed through 
		each edge around that vertex. We did so with very similar logic to that in lecture 8, where we first start at 
		the halfedge the vertex struct points to, and then iterate over the adjacent edges of the vertex by finding 
		the twin of the current halfedge, and then finding the next halfedge from the twin. We do so until we circle 
		back to the original halfedge (the halfedge pointed to in the vertex struct). Within each iteration we 
		calculate the area-weighted normal vector of each face. To find this normal vector, we first find the current 
		face we are at by accessing it from the current halfedge we are at in the current iteration, then we find each 
		vertex of this face by iterating over each halfedge of the current face. To do this, we once again followed 
		similar logic to that of lecture 8, where we find the halfedge pointed to by the face struct, then iterate 
		through each next halfedge until we circle back to the original halfedge of the face. Within each of these 
		inner iterations we add the vertex of the face, accessed from the current halfedge,  into a vector of 3D vectors. 
		Once these inner iterations are finished and we have all points of the face, we calculate the area-weighted normal 
		vector by calculating the cross product of the vector A - B and the vector A - C where A is vertex 1, B is 
		vertex 2, and C is vertex 3. Once we calculate the area-weighted normal vector of each face that shares this 
		vertex, we add up all these normal vectors. We then divide this summation of all normal vectors by the magnitude 
		of this summation and return the result, which is the area-weighted normal vector of the specific vertex.

		<h3>Part 4: Edge flip</h3>
		We initially drew out the triangle before and after the flips in order to visualize and see where the pointers 
		would map to. After figuring out what needed to be changed, we mapped out all edges and made sure to assign all 
		the half edges to their original elements to have references to them before modifying them. We did this for the 
		half edges, vertices, edges, and faces as each halfedge has all these properties. Then we went and reassigned 
		all the values based on the schema we drew out and went in order for each half edge property: next(), twin(), 
		vertex(), edge(), and face(). Even if a value didn't need to get reassigned to a new value, we had it there for reference 
		and for simplicity. Similarly, we did this for all half edges, vertices, edges, and faces in which we reassigned 
		them. Finally, we returned the e0 edge that was given with its new updated information.

		<h3>Part 5: Edge split</h3>
		Similar to task 4, we first drew out the before and after of an edge split with each having the appropriate 
		labels for each element (labels for each halfedge, vertex, edge, and face). This helped us conceptually as 
		well as knowing what pointers pointed to what. We then stored every face, vertex, edge, and halfedge that 
		could be changed or was needed after the split. We did not support edge splits at boundaries, so we checked 
		if either face adjacent to the edge was a boundary. If either was a boundary face we just returned immediately 
		as described in the spec. If not, we then found the midpoint of the two vertices that are connected by the given 
		edge. We then created any other new elements that were needed when edge splitting. With our case we created 6 
		new halfedges, 3 new edges, 2 new faces, and 1 vertex (the midpoint). The new vertex's position was set to the 
		midpoint. After this, we then moved on to reassigning all of our previous pointers and assigning our new pointer 
		to the desired element. Once all pointers have been reassigned/assigned, we return the new vertex. Luckily we 
		did not encounter any bugs while implementing this task... WRONG. When it came time to implementing 
		task 6, we realized that something was wrong with splitEdge. We tried a lot of things, such as reassigning our 
		variables every order possible, as we thought maybe there was something wrong with our ordering of reassignments. 
		It changed the way our upsample function worked at times, but it still didn't fix our issue. We then later realized 
		that the edge attribute, isNew, is never set to true anywhere, even though we are creating new edges. Once we 
		realized this, we set the isNew attribute to true for newly created edges that weren't along our current 
		edge. (edge e6 and e7 in our diagram).

		<h3>Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
		To implement the loop subdivision scheme, we first calculated the new positions of the old vertices by using 
		the formula given in the spec, (1 - n *u) * original_position + u * original_neighbor_position_sum. The u 
		value was calculated by checking if the vertex degree is 3, if it is we set u to 3 / 16, otherwise we set u 
		to 3 / (8 * n) where n is the degree of the vertex we are currently looking at. This new value was stored in 
		the vertex's newPosition attribute. We also set these vertex's boolean attribute, isNew, to false, so when we 
		flipped edges later, we had a way of tracking if the vertex connected by this edge was either new or old.
		<br>
		<br>
		Next we calculated the position of new vertices that would be created when using edge splits. To do so we found the 
		4 vertices that would impact the position of this new vertex. These included the two vertices that the edge connected 
		as well as the third vertex that was located on each face that the edge was between (two faces, so two more vertices). 
		Once we found these vertices, we used the equation given in the spec to calculate the positions of these new 
		vertices: 3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D) where A = v0-> position, B= v1->position, C= v2 -> position, D = v3->position. 
		Once this position was calculated, we stored it in the current edge's newPosition attribute so that we could access it 
		later. Before flipping we also stored the original edges in the mesh in a vector, called oldEdges, so that when we do 
		split, we only iterate over the original edges, not any new ones. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Finally we began to split every edge in the mesh. We iterated through all the edges in oldEdges and split them, setting 
		the new vertex's newPosition attribute to that current edge's newPosition. We set the isNew attribute of the newly created 
		vertex to true. We did so to ensure that all vertices' newPosition were whether they were a new vertex or not. After all 
		edges that needed to split were split, we iterated over all edges (old and new) to see if we needed to flip them. We first 
		checked if that edge was new or not (set in our edgeSplit function), if it was a new edge, we then checked if the vertices 
		connected by that edge were either true or false, but not both, as we only want to flip edges that connect an old and new 
		vertex. If both these cases passed, we flipped that edge. Finally, with the subdivisions complete, we set every vertex's 
		position to its newPosition attribute.
		<br>
		<br>
		Some challenges we encountered during debugging were dents that shouldn't appear obscuring the overall shape of the mesh, 
		the way we fixed this was making sure that when we split our edges, we had a boolean to check that those edges were new 
		and not old. Another problem which was brought up by TA - Ashley was the fact that Visual Studio might've “truncated” 
		3/8 and 1/8 to 0 so we explicitly wrote out 0.375 and 0.125 as otherwise the object would just “disappear”. The two 
		main issues we had were that we hadn't set all of the vertices' newPosition attribute to a value and that some of the 
		edges' isNew attributes were never set. To find the bug to these issues, we commented out certain steps to see if we 
		could find the issue. When we just had the splitting of all edges as well as flipping the edges that needed to be flipped, 
		we saw that there was a problem in which incorrect edges were flipped or some weren't when they needed to be. We fixed 
		this by modifying our splitEdge function to set the value of isNew to either true or false as described in our write 
		up for part 5. Once this was fixed, we still found that sometimes our mesh/object would just “disappear”. We read on 
		Ed that this could be caused by not setting all vertices' newPosition attribute to a value, since at the end we set the 
		vertices' position to their newPosition attribute. We saw that this happened when we were splitting edges. We had been 
		setting the new vertex's position to the current edge's newPosition when we should have been setting the vertex's 
		newPosition attribute.

		<br>
		After loop subdivision, we noticed that sharp corners and edges get smoothened out. We think this is a result of the 
		new positions of these vertices at these corners being based off the weighted average of the surrounding vertex positions. 
		We think that if we pre-split some edges near these corners, the smoothing will be less as there are now closer vertices 
		to these corners.

		<br>
		To preprocess, we just split the edge that was going through every face of the cube. So instead of one edge going through 
		each edge there were now 4. With this change, we can see that the mesh becomes more symmetrical after loop subdividing. 
		We believe these preprocessing changes helped with making the mesh more symmetrical as now there were more vertices 
		closer to each corner of the cube. With there being closer vertices, the weighted average calculated to find the new 
		position of these corners would not be as obscure as before, as the values would be smaller since they are closer to each 
		other. This would prevent the unsymmetrical shape produced when there is no preprocessing done.
